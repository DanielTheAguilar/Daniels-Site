  <p>My hobbies are very sperratic. I have had countless activites that have interested me in the past year alone. I went from working out (sort of) as a hobby, to film photography, which is one of the ones that stuck the best, to being really into modding thinkpads. And my modding I mean adding 4 more gb of ddr3 ram and calling my self a hackerman. My brain is very scattered. I am trying to get healthy hobbies to stick this year, before the end of 2022. I want to start journaling and working out more consistenyl. I also want to spend more time studying but I cant seem to bring my self to doing it. I also wanted to start thrifting clothes and make my own small clothing line with a heat press, but because of financial limitations, this lead no where.  </p>
